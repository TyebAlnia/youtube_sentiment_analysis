"Trumps win is probably the biggest underdog story in history. The media ripped him, Hollywood ripped him, the Democrats ripped him, professors ripped and even his own party the Republicans ripped him a lot of the time. And he still won. Think whatever you want about him but you can't deny it was historic"
Who’s here after Joe Biden president elect speech?
Who’s here after biden’s win
Anybody here after watching Biden speak at his victory party?
i like how his youngest son is just awkwardly standing there
His son is just like yeah my dads president bla bla can i just get back home and play fortnite now lol
Such an amazing night that was. I will always remember that day
"I am here after hearing Biden's speech to make comparation and wow, Biden's was such a breath of fresh SANE air"
It's funny how he thanks all the team and then almost everyone left or got fired from his administration lmao
WHAT A GLORIOUS NIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I love when Trump got to the podium that the crowd chanted, ""USA USA USA"" they vote for him because they want America first"
Am I the only one that heard a dude literally yell “Kill Obama” at 9:48 ?? 😡  and that little kid reacted too it like WTF!!
It’s so weird to see them all up there close and no masks
03:39 - This might possibly be the most brilliantly American thing I've even seen.
And four years later he has falsely claimed victory and pouting the fact he’ll lose 😂😂
"""First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win."" (Mahatma Gandhi)"
That music...that moment...that entire movement.  Praying for a repeat in 2020 for the sanctity of the country.
That soundtrack gave me goosebumps ✌️❤️
Anyone else watching this on the day Joe Biden got elected?
I just came here after Joe Biden’s Victory speech just to see how the tables have turned.
"As a Hillary supporter, I am not bitter nor do I hold any sort of grudge. I am 26 years old tomorrow, and I realize that I've got a lot of experiences to have in my life before I can really understand what the Trump supporters believed in. Honestly, I'm excited anyway! Sure Hillary lost, but you know what? This is a democracy.... we vote, and the majority rules, so hey...... "
That music from the Movie Air force one❤️❤️❤️. Waiting for 4 more years Mr President. Never Let Biden get on ur Plane and Castle
"you know watching these 4 year old videos of people is just surprising how much appearance changes in that little of time, especially baron he is as tall as a tree now"
"Today's his last day in office so I thought I'd watch this to relive this amazing night. Thank you for everything, you're the most misunderstood man ever and the media portrayed you as a monster. Thanks for everything you did for us 45!"
"Sadly this was one of his better moments, then he went with American Carnage speech not long after"
"I bet when hillary called trump, he let it ring a couple times before answering.... just to make her wait."
Notice how they say “USA! USA! USA!” while at Hillary’s events they say “Hill-ar-y”
"Those were the happiest days they will never,never see again!!! I bet they wish they could relive this!!!"
Shut I can’t stop looking at his poor kid. He was dying to go to sleep he literally falls asleep for seconds. WOW!! poor kids.
Liberty 24 is now Air Force One! Who feels like you'd just gotten pulled aboard the rescue craft?
Donald Trump- the man who gave up his lavish and luxurious lifestyle and endured being ridiculed and smeared by the media to save America.
It's interesting because he actually sounded somewhat coherent here. These days he just sounds like an angry kid that wants to get his way no matter what. What happened?
I will ALWAYS LOVE THIS !!!!!!!
I love this man!! Thank you good sir you are beautiful!!!
I got to say I like how they choose the song from Air Force One...
"Sorry to keep you waiting, Complicated Business"
"Eu tambem, estou aqui desde ontem."
"The sequel it's taking longer then expected, so I guess it must be better 🙃"
Lmaooo
"who’s not here after biden’s 
inauguration. i’m here because 
i went down the mj rabbit whole 
and somehow ended up here lol."
you can see the emotion in his face. after all they put him through. the slander. the hate. the false accusations. he tears up knowing he overcame everything they threw at him. almost everyone turned their back on him. people stopped supporting and the media and celebs and hilary made him look like a monster. he overcame it all.
"So his opponent called and congratulated him when he won this election, but he hasn't called Biden....hmmmm."
"Who's here after Joe Biden's speech?
👇🏻"
Barron eye-rolling at 20:21 was my entire mood for the last 4 years
Oreos are tasty 😋
"When Trump enters with his family, is it just me or doesn't he have the sweetest expression on his face? Actually humbled? He looks like he really cares."
2020🤪🤪
I'm watching this just to see how much better Biden's speech was compared to this one.
"Looking back after his first and only term, it’s even more clear that these were all empty promises."
千古一帝
"Obama's election: loud music
Trump's election: people chanting ""U.S.A.!"""
😂😂😂😂 this s jus awesome
This speech felt more as if he just won the Oscars not the presidency lol
I think he forgot about wanting to unite everyone lol
Can't wait for this to happen again in a couple of days
"Im not letting a president determine the quality of life i have, nomatter who won im still gonna progress daily as a human  and respect everyone for who we are."
Now that I know what the “index finger to the thumb” 👌hand gestures means this speech looks and sounds so different.
I came for the “who’s here after Biden’s speech” comments
Hearing this speech is so funny after seeing how his presidency actually turned out. It's literally the opposite of everything he did
Anyone notice that he mentions everyone on the stage except pence n then at the end when he remembers to say thank you to pence he gives these super aggressive handshakes pulling him in intensely? Odd
It looks like Baron (Donald's son) just wanted to go home and play some video games
This looks so much darker then today.
09:47 🤡🤡🤡🤡
"The music by the rolling Stones, lyrics ""you can't always get what you want"" for Trump's stage music says so much about a lot of us in the country felt when he became president of the USSR annex"
I came right after Joe Biden's speech to see the difference. Who else?
at 4:26 you can see a tear in trumps eye. He truly wants to serve the American people.
"And I’m watching this on New Years Eve, over a month after Biden gave his victory speech and won the election, even in the Electoral Colleges."
Lets see another one next week !!
LOL I’m just comparing the two speeches and I feel so much more moved by Biden’s
"1992: Phantom Menace

1996: Attack of the clones"
"remember this day, social justice warriors. It was you who helped him win."
14:20
"I am here to officially point out that scary ass secret service agent with the long curly hair, and the soul piercing death stare."
HAHAHAHA
Who's here in 2020 where Biden is smoking him
"Sorry to keep you waiting, complicated business 👌🏻"
This political system is a mess. And the society is getting there
"After 4 years of non stop winning, I'm just tired, If this maniac had won 4 more I'm not sure what I would have done. Tying a huge amount of weather balloons to my deck chair and see what happens was high on the list."
Let’s play a game! Count how many have been Indicted!!! You get bonus points if you can spot the 1 Term President😉
Who's watching this after Trump lost. Good times
It's like watching the ending to the greatest movie ever. With a happy ending too :)
MWAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
"Donald Trump: Win elections in 2016

Joe Biden: I'm going to end this man's whole career !"
Happy  women day
The people spoke: We prefer the genuine liar over the deceptive one.
I stayed up till 4 in the morning and still went to school with my MAGA shirt no one made eye contact or even talked to me
I can’t wait for the 2020 Victory speech!
It seems me it was yesterday. Time passes too fast
His kid makes this video gold
🤣🤣
"The absolute madlad finished his speech with the song ""You can't always get what you want""

And you wonder why Trump is so popular."
"Time is flying so fast 😞
Already 4 years ago..."
Somebody should have played this in public just to prank them.
Welcome to a moment in History
3:19
Was Mr. Trump about to cry? At the beginning? God Bless the United States of America and the President-Elect Donald J. Trump!
that kid is like wtf is happening how did this guy win 😂
Who is here for comparison?
Imagine watching this live in 2016. You would have to watch him for 4 more years...
I hate the man but playing that song after a victory speech is amazing.
"Look how happy and humbled Trump was walking to that stage. He realizes the position he is now in. Godspeed, President Trump. Make America Great Again!"
WHOS HERE FROM BIDEN W
"Remembering the moment when the nightmare began, now that is finally over"
😭😭😭😭😭
Interesting song choice. Sympathy for the Devil 😈
"That night, almost two years ago, I joined a bunch of Deplorable groups on Facebook and met the woman of my dreams. We both consider Donald Trump as the one who brought us together. I love this man"
I look back on this and release this guy couldn’t even unify a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Hahahahahaha
bi den: by then
Haha.
"Thank you to all the people in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania who got out and voted for Trump. We couldn't have done this without you!"
KEKW
This comes off as a comedy routine after watching his first term play out.
I came here for a good laugh and got one 🤣
Who’s here after biden’s win?
what an epic night!!! i will never forget it!!!! Mr President Donald J. Trump!!!
"You know how trumps saying, “ stop counting votes.” Well that’s me telling my teacher, “stop counting my bad assignments, OR I WILL GO ON TWITTER AND THROW A HUGE FIT LIKE  A 2 YEAR OLD.”"
"Well, thankfully it was not eight years of this. #imridinwithbiden"
He thanks Mike Pence in the last 5 seconds of his speech. I found that hilarious
Who's here after the 2020 election.😂😂😂
